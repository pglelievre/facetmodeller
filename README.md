FacetModeller: Software for manual creation, manipulation and analysis of 3D surface-based models

CONDITIONS OF USE:  
- Properly cite usage of FacetModeller in any publications resulting from its use.  
- Promptly inform the developers of any such publications.  
- Promptly inform the developers of any bugs or issues encountered while using FacetModeller.  
- Users agree that their name and institution or company position may appear on the developers' academic websites in a list of users of FacetModeller.
- Free for academic use. Please see documentation for further policies.

Directory "Documentation" contains ... you guessed it ... documentation. Please see the other readme file inside that directory for more information.

If you are just hoping to run FacetModeller, grab one of the "dist" directories and launch file "FacetModeller.jar" inside it:
- The "FacetModeller/dist8" folder contains the FacetModeller distribution as a compiled .jar file using JDK 8.
- The "FacetModeller/dist19" folder contains the FacetModeller distribution as a compiled .jar file using JDK 19.

If you want to do some development, read on.

Directory "FacetModeller/src" contains Java source code. That code is dependent on the source code in my "mylibrary" repository, subdirectory "MyLibrary". There is also a rather hokey dependency diagram that I started drawing and probably gave up long ago when things started getting too complicated. That's what you can expect with free software.
