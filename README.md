FacetModeller: Software for manual creation, manipulation and analysis of 3D surface-based models

Free for academic use. Please see documentation for further policies.

Directories "FacetModeller" and "MyLibrary" contains Java source code. These were taken from a NetBeans project so the directory structure should work in the NetBeans IDE.

Directory "Documentation" contains ... you guessed it ... documentation. Please see the other readme file inside that directory for more information.
