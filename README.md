# facetmodeller
FacetModeller: Software for manual creation, manipulation and analysis of 3D surface-based models

Free for academic use. Please see documentation for further policies.

If you are just hoping to run FacetModeller, grab directory "FacetModeller/dist" and launch file "FacetModeller/dist/FacetModeller.jar". If you want to do some development, read on.

Directory "FacetModeller" contains Java source code. That code is dependend on the source code in my "mylibrary" repository, subdirectory "MyLibrary". These were taken from a NetBeans project so the directory structure should work in the NetBeans IDE.

Directory "Documentation" contains ... you guessed it ... documentation. Please see the other readme file inside that directory for more information.
